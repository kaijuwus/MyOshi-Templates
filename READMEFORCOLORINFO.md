As you use my templates, here is some extra explanations about the values you see! 

rgba(255,154,196,.76)

This just means 

rgba(255,154,196,.76)
      ↑   ↑   ↑    ↑
      R   G   B   transparency

0  → no color
255 → max color

255,0,0 = pure red

0,255,0 = green

0,0,255 = blue

255,255,255 = white

So RGB is just mixing red, green, and blue light.

The last value controls how see through it is.

Value	Meaning:
1	fully solid
.8	mostly solid
.6	soft glass
.3	very transparent
0	invisible

Pastel glass usually is between .65 – .80.

If you have changed the original code too much here is the default colors!
